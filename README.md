# Synthetic-Dataset-ECG-MIT-BIH
Reconstruction ECG Signal MIT-BIH for five Classes
Repository Data Description

This repository is a uniquely compiled dataset, synthesized using Multi-GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) frameworks and reconstructed with advanced transformer techniques, segmented from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The data spans across multiple classes derived from ECG (Electrocardiogram) readings, which have been meticulously categorized to facilitate detailed biomedical analysis and the development of diagnostic algorithms.

The dataset is organized into six distinct classes, as follows:

Class 0: Normal - This class contains standard ECG recordings that exhibit typical cardiac rhythms, representing the baseline for normal heart function.

Class 1: Atrial Premature - Included in this class are ECG segments that show premature beats originating in the atria, a common variation in heart rhythm that may or may not be symptomatic.

Class 2: Atrial Premature - (Note: This appears to be a duplicate of Class 1 in the provided information. If this is not an error and the class is meant to represent a different subtype or condition, further specific details should be provided here.)

Class 3: Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) - This class encompasses ECG tracings with premature ventricular contractions, an arrhythmia characterized by extra heartbeats originating in one of the ventricles.

Class 4: Fusion of Ventricular and Normal - Data within this class represents a fusion between normal heartbeats and those from the ventricles, providing essential insights into complex arrhythmias where multiple signal origins are present.

Class 5: Fusion of Paced and Normal - The ECG data here is indicative of a hybrid rhythm where normal spontaneous heart activity is combined with paced beats, commonly seen in patients with artificial pacemakers.

All datasets have been rigorously tested and validated to ensure their relevance and accuracy for studies focusing on arrhythmia classification, cardiac signal processing, and machine learning applications in healthcare. Access to the data is granted on a reasonable request basis, with the intention of promoting collaborative efforts in advancing cardiac care and research.
